# EDHL-Overlay
An overlay generator based on a Google Sheet ran EDH League meant to be used by OBS streams/recordings

# Pre-Reqs
Intall node 16.14.0, I use a node version manager cli called nvm.

# How to run
In the project root do `npm install` and then `npm start`. This will build the react app once and have it be staically served, hot reloading is enabled on the server directory.

# How to dev
In project root do `npm install` and then `npm dev`. This will set the development environment variable as well as enable some home brewed hot reloading on UI changes. Should be platform independent as well.
