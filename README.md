# EDHL
A webapp that supports running an EDH league

# Pre-Reqs
Intall node 16.14.0, I use a node version manager cli called nvm.

# How to run
In the project root do `npm install` and then `npm run start`. This will build the react app once and have it be staically served, hot reloading is enabled on the server directory.

# How to dev
In project root do `npm install` and then `npm run dev`. This will set the development environment variable as well as enable some home brewed hot reloading on UI changes. Should be platform independent as well.
